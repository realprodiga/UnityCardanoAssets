**A comprehensive, open-source SDK to integrate the Cardano Blockchain into Unity games.**

Developed with support from **Project Catalyst Fund 12**, this SDK provides lightweight, data-oriented scripts to interact with Cardano via **Blockfrost** or **Koios** APIs. It is designed to be a "drop-in" solution—no complex dependencies or heavy libraries required.

---

## ✨ Features
*   **🔌 Dual Provider Support:** Seamless integration for both **Blockfrost** (API Key required) and **Koios** (Free/Public).
*   **🛠️ Data-Oriented Inspector:** View Blockchain data (ADA Balance, Assets, Transactions) directly in the Unity Inspector for easy debugging.
*   **📝 Extensible Framework:** Both integration scripts include a commented, 6-step framework allowing you to easily add new API endpoints.
*   **📱 Lightweight:** No external DLLs or heavy plugins. Just pure C# `UnityWebRequest`.

---

## 📥 Installation

1.  **Download:**
    *   Clone this repository or [Download ZIP](https://github.com/realprodiga/UnityCardanoAssets/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).
2.  **Import:**
    *   Copy the `Assets/Scripts` folder from this repo into your Unity Project's `Assets` folder.
    *   *(Optional)* Copy `Assets/Scenes` if you want to see the example setup.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Option A: Using Blockfrost
*Best for production reliability and higher rate limits.*

1.  Get a Project ID from [Blockfrost.io](https://blockfrost.io/).
2.  In Unity, create a new GameObject (e.g., `CardanoManager`).
3.  Add the `BlockfrostIntegration` component.
4.  **Configuration:**
    *   Paste your **Project ID**.
    *   Enter a **Stake Address** (e.g., `stake1...`) to fetch account info.
    *   Enter an **Address** (e.g., `addr1...`) to fetch address info.
    *   Enter a **Transaction Hash** to fetch specific transaction details.
5.  **Press Play.**
    *   Expand the `--- LOADED DATA ---` foldout in the Inspector to see real-time data from the blockchain.

### Option B: Using Koios
*Best for free access and decentralization.*

1.  In Unity, create a new GameObject.
2.  Add the `KoiosIntegration` component.
3.  **Configuration:**
    *   The `Base Url` is pre-set to Mainnet (`https://api.koios.rest/api/v1`).
    *   Enter your target **Stake Address**, **Address**, or **Transaction Hash**.
4.  **Press Play.**
    *   Expand the `--- LOADED DATA ---` foldout in the Inspector to view the results.

## 🛠️ How to Extend (The Framework)

We know every game is unique. You might need the current Epoch number, specific pool details, or network parameters. We built these scripts with a **6-Step Framework** that makes adding new API endpoints easy, even if you are new to working with APIs.

### 🎓 Tutorial: Adding "Latest Epoch"

Let's say your game needs to know the current **Cardano Epoch number**. Here is how you would add that feature using the framework.

#### 1. Find the Data
First, visit the [Blockfrost Documentation](https://docs.blockfrost.io/).
1.  In the left sidebar, look for the **Cardano > Epochs** group.
2.  Click on `Latest Epoch` (or `GET /epochs/latest`).
3.  Look at the **Response** JSON to find the data you want:

    {
      "epoch": 225,              <-- WE WANT THIS!
      "start_time": 1603403091,
      "end_time": 1603835086,
      ...
    }

Now, open `BlockfrostIntegration.cs` and follow the numbered steps in the code:

#### [Step 1] Create the Data Class
This is the "clean" container for your game data. We use **PascalCase** (e.g., `EpochNumber`) because this is what you will see in the Unity Inspector. It should be easy to read.

    // [FRAMEWORK STEP 1: Add public Data Class here]
    [System.Serializable] 
    public class BlockfrostEpochData { 
        public int EpochNumber; 
    }

#### [Step 2] Create the JSON Mapper
This is the "raw" container. Unity's `JsonUtility` is strict—the variable name here **must match the JSON key exactly**.
*   In the docs, the key is `"epoch"`.
*   Therefore, our variable must be `public int epoch;`.

    // [FRAMEWORK STEP 2: Add JSON Mapper here]
    [System.Serializable] 
    class BlockfrostEpochRaw { 
        public int epoch; 
    }

#### [Step 3] Add the Variable
Create a slot for your data class so it appears in the Unity Inspector. We'll name it `CurrentEpoch` so it's easy to find.

    // [FRAMEWORK STEP 3: Add new public variables here]
    public BlockfrostEpochData CurrentEpoch; 

#### [Step 4] Write the Fetch Function
This is the worker function. It goes to the URL, gets the raw data, and moves it into your clean data class.
*   **The URL:** We see in the docs the endpoint is `/epochs/latest`. We append that to our `MainnetUrl`.

    // [FRAMEWORK STEP 4: Implement new Coroutines here]
    private IEnumerator FetchEpoch()
    {
        // Build the specific URL based on the documentation
        string url = $"{MainnetUrl}/epochs/latest";         
        
        // Create the authorized request
        UnityWebRequest request = CreateRequest(url); 
        yield return request.SendWebRequest();
    
        if (request.result == UnityWebRequest.Result.Success)
        {
            // 1. Convert text to Raw Data (using the Step 2 class)
            var info = JsonUtility.FromJson<BlockfrostEpochRaw>(request.downloadHandler.text);
            
            // 2. Move data to Public Data (using the Step 1 class)
            CurrentEpoch.EpochNumber = info.epoch;
        }
    }

#### [Steps 5 & 6] Initialize and Run
Finally, scroll down to the `OnEnable()` function. We need to make sure the class exists before we use it (Step 5) and then tell Unity to run the fetch function (Step 6).

    private void OnEnable()
    {
        // ... existing initialization ...
    
        // [FRAMEWORK STEP 5: Initialize new data classes here]
        CurrentEpoch = new BlockfrostEpochData();
    
        // ... existing coroutines ...
    
        // [FRAMEWORK STEP 6: Start new Coroutines here]
        StartCoroutine(FetchEpoch());
    }

**🎉 Done!** When you press Play in Unity, your script will now fetch the Latest Epoch, and you will see `EpochNumber: 225` (or current) appear in the Inspector.
